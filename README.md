# Spotify Data Analysis

Project for Visual Analytics course (2024/25) at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/pagina-strutturale/home).
## Overview
The rapid expansion of music streaming platforms
has led to vast amounts of audio data, providing
an opportunity to analyze and understand listener
preferences. This study explores Spotifyâ€™s extensive track
dataset to identify key musical attributes influencing song
popularity. Using a dataset of over 586,672 songs, we
analyze features such as danceability, energy, valence,
and acousticness to uncover correlations with track success.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-Distributed
Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), and K-Means
clustering are applied to extract patterns, which are
visualized using scatter plots, heatmaps, and interactive
time-series visualizations. The findings provide insights
for music producers, streaming platforms, and analysts,
helping to optimize song attributes and enhance playlist
curation.
